## SvgPublish sharepoint web part

An EARLY PREVIEW (alpha) of SvgPublish sharepoint integration webpart
Work in progress, everything will be changing here.

Please add feature requests in the issue list :)
For now what's anticipated:
- possiblity to load SVG exproted from Visio (maybe even directly without opening Visio)
This would avoid security warning and iframe when running in the SharePoint.

- (maybe) importing Visio files directly.

- (maybe) using importing SVG files not coming from Visio at all

- (maybe) live connection to sharepoint data.
